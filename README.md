hey folks, 

welcome to the **Net-Sec-Toolkit** this is where we mix it up with C code for the BE 
and TypeScript with React for the FE. and we're getting our hands dirty with Python scripts and a bit of Bash

few features:
- we're flooding remote PCs with well-known DoS attacks like SYN floods
- cracking hashes with the reverse hash feature
- brute forcing remote PCs' SSH credentials using Hydra
- all of these features are accessible straight from the web-based emulated terminal and more

tech stack:
- **Backend**: C
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React
- **Scripting**: Python, Bash
